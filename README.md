:construction_worker:
***I work with multiple languages, proficiently in C#, C++, JavaScript, Pawn/Amx, CLEO/Sanny Builder, and some basic of (.NET, SQL, Python, Lua and Java).
Formerly a game hacker/dev, sometimes trying to reverse engineer programs online etc. And probably busy with school/career if you're seeing this.***

# 

:bulb:
I have a really inconsistent work of flow, I work with multiple languages at the same time or I don't target a specific language. I go with whatever suits my project regardless of how much knowledge I have and intend to self-learn and use it as experience.
