:construction_worker:
***I work with multiple languages, proficiently in C#, C++, JavaScript, Pawn/Amx, CLEO/Sanny Builder, and some basic of (.NET, SQL, Python, Lua and Java).***

# 

:bulb:
I have a really inconsistent work of flow, I work with multiple languages at the same time or I don't target a specific language. I go with whatever suits my project regardless of how much knowledge I have and intend to self-learn and use it as experience.

:technologist: 
**Platforms I' publicly worked on:** *(Mostly game scripting)*

- [SA:MP](https://sa-mp.com/) Server scripting, Pwn'ing multiplayer servers (memory hacking and very very little reverse engineering)
- [IV:MP](http://www.iv-mp.eu/) Server scripting
- [RAGE:MP](https://rage.mp/) Server scripting (developed LSCC:V, now Race 'n' Chase on GTAV)
- [Minecraft/Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/) Plugin Development (no longer working)
- [Minecraft/ComputerCraft](https://computercraft.info/) Making programs in Lua (no longer working)

I've worked on many other platforms as well.
